# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
To analyze historical stock market data for selected companies, identify patterns and trends, and build a machine learning model to predict future stock prices.
Below is a template for a README file for the "Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning" project. You can adjust the content to fit the specifics of your project as you progress.

## Project Overview

---

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data for selected companies to identify patterns and trends. It then leverages machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices. The primary goal is to provide insights into stock market dynamics and offer a predictive outlook that could be useful for investors and financial analysts.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the stock data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implements basic feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Builds a simple linear regression model to predict future stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the model's performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, yfinance

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

Linux and macOS:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance jupyterlab
```

Windows:

```bash
py -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance jupyterlab
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the project directory.
3. Run each cell in the notebook to perform data collection, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Contributing to the Project

Contributions to the project are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make changes and commit (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
